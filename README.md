# Fatum Database Adapters

Fatum Adapters for SQL databases

# Why?

Data is sent to the adapters and retrieved from the adapters using the Fatum Tree structures (mid-serialized.) The purpose of this is to allow database data to be manipulated with the same tools and in the same matter as the rest of the Data-In-Motion libraries.
